1. id reduction pattern (a, b, c, d) -> (d-a, b-a, c-b, d-c)
2. maximize # jumps-> to reduce to (0, 0, 0, 0) where a < b < c < d <= 10,000 and min(a+b+c+d)

Answer: like 42 jumps or something I don't remember but if you run printsequence.py you can verify
!!!!!!! we won the intern challenge with this work

printsequence.py
~~~
give 4 numbers and produce the list of jumps with no reduction
works good for verification

~~~
trade.cpp
~~~
0.  Create a hashMap between keys representing (0, x, y, z) and the associated reduction jump counts.
        Insert the basecase { h(0,0,0,0) , 0 }

1.  Iterate through (0, b, c, d) in order of discreet sums
        I.e., 0 < b < c < d <= sum

3.  Give each iteration ct = 0

4.  For a given sequence apply the transformation f(a,b,c,d)
        I.e., subtract the minimum number and divide by the GCD
    Calculate the hash key + look it up
    If it exists, add the count to ct
    Else insert into hashMap; ct++; subtract the differences; repeat step 4

5. Once we have the count, if this is better than the max count, print out the sequence, sum, and jumps.

jumps.cpp
~~~
does not really dealy with the minimal number of stocks, but will help searching for best jumps
